<h2>Foreword</h2>
<p>
    In this writing, the CAT S22 Flip will henceforth be known as the
    &#39;Cat&#39;.<br><br> The writing assumes you&#39;re already tending
    towards a dumbphone, it does not make an argument for one. This is a piece
    on the Cat, not on Digital Minimalism, though there is naturally an
    overlap.
</p>

<h2>It&#39;s not a Dumbphone</h2>
<p>
    Shock. Horror. Why bother then? Dumbphones are Feature Phones, like the
    Nokia Brick (old and new). Whilst the Cat is a flip phone, it runs Android
    11 Go (the lite version). It is technically a smartphone but it is commonly
    referred to as a dumbphone because of its limited practicality.
</p>
<p>
    I like to think about the Cat in two minds. Firstly, it&#39;s a
    transitionary phone, it&#39;s for those not yet ready or those who simply
    don&#39;t want to abandon modern operating systems (you&#39;re likely stuck
    with Android). I think it&#39;s a fair enough camp, it&#39;s a pretty big
    ask of somebody to uproot their entire workflow and jump straight to a
    Brick, especially when they have no alternatives set-up for what they
    currently do on their phone. The second group of people are those who can&#39;t
    turn away from a smartphone. I use WhatsApp for scheduling work shifts, if
    I took it off my phone and could only check my messages on my laptop, I
    would never be quick enough to pick up those shifts and then I would go
    hungry :/
</p>
<p>
    Transitioning to a less-capable phone isn&#39;t really about &quot;doing
    less&quot; in life. Digital Minimalism isn&#39;t about scaling back and
    living a more isolated life, away from being able to interact with the
    world, it&#39;s about using technology intentionally. My current strategy
    is to separate &#39;tasks&#39; into different categories and having
    different devices for those. The Cat fulfils my Communication category:
    Text‚úÖ, Call‚úÖ, WhatsApp‚úÖ.
</p>

<h2>Making a Plan</h2>
<p>
    When my Cat arrived, it stayed in the box for a week. The plan I had made
    about how to use it seemed impractical once it was in my hands. For a long
    time now I&#39;ve dumbed down my smartphones. My favourite launcher is
    Unlauncher on Fdroid, I run my devices in greyscale; it made the leap from
    a smartphone to the Cat more manageable but also more pointless. I would
    recommend trying a minimalist launcher as a feel for the minimalist
    life.
</p>
<p>
    For a little while I had planned to rent a new Sim, my current (would be
    &#39;old&#39;/&#39;public&#39;) number would stay in the smartphone, and
    for all purposes, that&#39;s the number I would give out to everybody. The
    new sim would go in the Cat, known only by my partner with knowledge only
    to ring me in a true emergency. Importantly, I could still contact 999. In
    times where I want to be alone, it would allow me to go on my walks or
    cycle rides in a true disconnected-but-safe manner. When comparing
    compatible sims (more on this later), I found SMARTY&#39;s sims to be a
    solid deal, though I&#39;m yet to see them stocked in a store. It seems
    that large supermarkets aren&#39;t selling such a wide collection of sims
    anymore. They&#39;re available on Amazon, but I can&#39;t bring myself to
    checkout a ¬£0.10 (pre-activation) item with a ¬£3.99 delivery fee.
</p>
<p>
    On WhatsApp you can add &#39;Linked Devices&#39;, recent changes allow
    these
    devices to not even need a Sim card even if they&#39;re not a PC. I have
    the Cat as my primary device, with my tablet and laptop as linked devices.
    I would recommend doing something similar, texting longer messages on the
    Cat is arduous, and the screen is a little small to see loved ones.

<h2>Considering Bands ü•Åüé∏üßë‚Äçüé§</h2>
<p>!! Region: UK !!<br>
    <em>
        If you&#39;re outside the UK, this will still work but you&#39;ll have
        to source your own links.

    This process is confusing. This phone was produced for American
    audiences.

            Sim carriers are categorised into Host and Virtual operators.
            Virtual carriers piggyback off host sim towers. Take a moment to
            see
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mobile_virtual_network_operators_in_the_United_Kingdom">who
                actually operates</a> your sim.

            Check the &#39;Network&#39; documentation by
            <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/cat_s22_flip-11141.php">GSM
                Arena</a>,
            the Cat supports a fair few 4G bands. Cross-reference the bands
            with
            this article
            <a href="https://kenstechtips.com/index.php/uk-network-frequency-bands">here</a>,
            it lists the bands supported by different carriers.

        <p>
            If your carrier supports a same band as the phone, it&#39;s a
            matchüíñ!
        </p>

    My iD Mobile (Three) sim works on the Cat. I&#39;ve seen but can&#39;t
    confirm the following sims
    <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dumbphones/comments/15av51j/cat_s22_flip_uk_questions/">vouched</a>:
    SMARTY (Three), Lebara (Vodafone), EE, and giffgaff (O2). Where virtual
    operators work, that signifies the host will work, i.e., you could go
    straight to Three.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>TL;DR</strong>: iD (Three)‚úÖ, SMARTY (Three)‚úÖ, Lebara (Vodafone)‚úÖ,
    EE‚úÖ, giffgaff (O2)‚úÖ.
</p>

<h2>Niche Points of Consideration</h2>
<p>
    My smartphone used to be a major device in my two-factor authentication
    system. When logging into a service, I might have to open an app and
    approve the login from there, or I might have to wait for a notification
    and tap &#39;Confirm&#39;; actions that aren&#39;t possible on a dumbphone,
    before I switched to the Cat, I was already in the midst of replacing
    phone auth with a security token. I wouldn&#39;t recommend putting up a
    stink with somebody demonstrating their persuasiveness in wanting your
    smartphone. Since typically leaving my smartphone at home, I feel less
    weight on my shoulders when walking around the city because the barrier of
    re-entry to my accounts is low-to-unaffected (some services still primarily
    use SMS auth üôÑ).
