        <h2>I am an aspiring Computer Scientist with an interest in Cybersecurity! üòÅ</h2>
        <p>UK based college student studying A-levels in Mathematics, Computer
            Science and Film Studies. I have also completed an EPQ for the extra
            credit. Sometimes I have the odd occasion where I've found the time
            (and motivation) to work on projects, of which the most notable can
            be found on my <a href=https://github.com/zayKenyon target="_blank">GitHub</a>.
            Most of my work is done in Python with newer experimentation done
            in C.
