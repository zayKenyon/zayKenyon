    i ran out of milk and it made me sad.<br>
    my mornings arent the same. i havent<br>
    been to the store in days.<br>
    <br>
    the fridge is running empty;<br>
    i snack on dry cereal.<br>
    <br>
    hours shift, late nights become early mornings.<br>
    i wonder if i should pull an all-nighter, for fun,<br>
    i reason.<br>
    <br>
    minutes tick-by now. waiting,<br>
    five now, ten more still,<br>
    waiting to pass so i can progress<br>
    to the next stage.<br>
    <br>
    music on, cant bear thinking about what damage im doing<br>
    thinking back to who i was last week.<br>
    tyres were deflated, seat was too low, and yet,<br>
    i cycled to the store. so why,<br>
    when it should be easier,<br>
    cant i go?<br>
