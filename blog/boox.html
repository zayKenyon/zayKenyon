    I am fortunate enough to often be stopped by strangers for a conversation.
    When working, it's generally out of curiosity as to what I'm using to study.

  <p>
    It's the BOOX Go Tablet 10.3, it's an Android e-ink device with pen
    recognition.

  <h3>Software</h3>
  <p>
    I'm a university student which means I need to do a lot of pre-reading in
    preparation for my lectures. I use the Calibre software to manage and
    organise the different types of documents I need: Textbooks, Lecture
    Slides, Exercise Sheets, and Problem Class Sheets.
