        I am a Computer Science Undergraduate with a focus in Cybersecurity, studying at the <a href="https://www-users.york.ac.uk/~vvt520/">University of York</a>.
        <br>
        Awarded A*AB, A* in my A-levels: Computer Science, Film Studies, Mathematics,
        and an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Project_Qualification">Extended Project Qualification</a>: "Can I make a school extra-curricular
        communication and management app inspired by the interface of Discord?"

        I am a RLSS certified Lifeguard, holding an NPLQ (Gen. 10) and AED certificate. Working as a Lifeguard has dramatically improved my people skills,
        including de-escalating and finding solutions to customers' problems, working in a team environment to manage set-ups and set-downs whilst under
        heavy time pressure, and succinctly communicating questions to staff and customers during loud sessions through gestures. I have experience
        operating a moveable floor down to 370cm with accompanying springboards, and can effectively run a diving session with heights of 5 and 10 metres.
